# Internet Of Things Projects

Welcome to my repository for the **Internet of Things** course held at Politecnico di Milano (a.a. 2024-2025).
Here you'll find all my solutions and documentation for the in-course challenges and homework. Each task covered different aspects of IoT systems, from sensor integration to networking and control logic. 🚀

## 🔧 Challenge 1

**Description:**  
Developed on **Wokwi**, this challenge involved creating a simple **parking occupancy node** using an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor** paired with an **ESP32**. The node transmits data using **ESP-NOW** communication protocol.  
The project also includes:
- Computing the **duty-cycle** of the node
- Estimating **energy consumption** for low-power operation analysis

## 📡 Challenge 2

**Description:**  
This challenge focused on **network traffic analysis**. Given a `.pcapng` capture file (`challenge2.pcapng`), the task was to:
- Analyze the traffic using **Wireshark** or basic **Python scripts**
- Identify and interpret packets related to **CoAP** and **MQTT** protocols
